# PhotoStack migration page

This is the landing page for [edit.photostack.app](https://edit.photostack.app), which used to be the domain for the PhotoStack editor from 2020 to 2023. It explains that PhotoStack has moved to the main [photostack.app](https://photostack.app) domain, and allows users to export any watermarks saved in the old editor.

This page exists to capture users opening old bookmarks and installed PWAs, users opening an outdated version of the Microsoft Store app (which will be updated to the main domain), and all users of the discontinued Android PWA wrapper app on the Play Store. `index.html` and `404.html` are identical.
